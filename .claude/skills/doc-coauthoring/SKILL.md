# Doc Co-Authoring Workflow Summary

This workflow guides collaborative document creation through three structured stages:

## Three Stages

**Stage 1: Context Gathering** asks meta-questions about document type, audience, and desired impact, then encourages comprehensive information sharing to close knowledge gaps.

**Stage 2: Refinement & Structure** builds the document section-by-section through clarifying questions, brainstorming 5-20 options, curating selections, and iteratively refining drafts using targeted edits rather than full rewrites.

**Stage 3: Reader Testing** validates the document works for fresh readers by either testing with sub-agents (if available) or having users test with a separate Claude conversation to catch blind spots.

## Key Principles

The workflow emphasizes that "the goal is a document that actually works for readers" by avoiding context bleed and testing assumptions. It prioritizes user agency—users can skip stages or work freeform if preferred.

Process notes include using `str_replace` for edits (never reprinting full documents), providing artifact links after changes, and addressing context gaps proactively rather than letting them accumulate.

## Trigger Conditions

Offer this workflow when users mention writing documentation, proposals, specs, decision docs, RFCs, or similar substantial writing tasks.
