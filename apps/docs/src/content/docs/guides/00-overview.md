description: A chronological history of how this application was built, serving as both tutorial and context.
---

This section documents the complete development history of Ember, from initial setup to current state. Each guide represents a significant milestone in the project's evolution.

## Purpose

These guides serve multiple purposes:
- **Tutorial**: New developers can follow along to understand how the project was built
- **Context for AI**: Provides historical context for AI assistants working on the codebase
- **Living Documentation**: Grows alongside the project as new features are added
- **Decision Log**: Records architectural choices and their rationale

## Development Timeline

1. [Initial Turborepo Setup](./01-initial-turborepo-setup) - Creating the TurboRepo foundation with Bun
2. [Astro Documentation Site](./02-astro-docs) - Replacing Next.js docs with Starlight
3. [Claude Code Integration](./03-claude-code) - Setting up AI-assisted development

## Documentation Pattern

Each guide follows a consistent structure:
- **What**: What was accomplished
- **Why**: Rationale behind the decision
- **How**: Step-by-step implementation
- **Commands**: Exact commands used (for reproducibility)
- **Outcomes**: What changed in the codebase
- **Context for AI**: Key details AI assistants should know

## Reading These Guides

- Read sequentially for the full development story
- Jump to specific guides for focused learning
- Use as reference when making similar decisions
- Update guides when revisiting or modifying features
